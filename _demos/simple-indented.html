# this file describes the
#
#   indented syntax

root/ # entry comments can be inline after a '#'
      # or on their own line, also after a '#'


  readme.md # a child of, 'root/', it's indented
            # under its parent. the width of the indent
            # is unimportant, consistency is

            # empty lines are ignored

  usage.md  # indented syntax is nice for small projects
            # and short comments.

  src/          # directories MUST be identified with a '/'
    fileOne.txt # files don't need any notation
    fileTwo*    # '*' can identify executables
    fileThree@  # '@' can identify symlinks
